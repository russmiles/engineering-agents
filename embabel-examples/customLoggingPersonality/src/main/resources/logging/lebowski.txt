Sooner or later, you’re going to have to face the fact that you’re a goddamn moron.
Obviously, you are not a golfer.
I had a rough night, and I hate the Eagles, man.
Careful, man, there’s a beverage here.
At least I’m housebroken.
New sh*t has come to light.
Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man.
This is a very complicated case, Maude. You know, a lotta ins, a lotta outs, a lotta what-have-yous. And, uh, a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.

Life does not start and stop at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit!
You see what happens, Larry? See what happens?
His life is in your hands, Dude.

I don’t roll on Shabbos!
He’s a good man… and thorough.
Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it is no dream.
Brothers Seamus? Like an Irish monk?
Oh… My plants are dead!
I’m unemployed.
