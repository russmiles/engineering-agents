# Embabel Example: Exploring seeing Server Sent Events (SSE) from an Embabel Agent

## Overview

Provides a walkthrough of exploring Server Sent Events from an Embabel runtime.

## Prerequisites

This project requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to be installed. We use `sdkman` to [make the magic happen](https://sdkman.io/sdks/maven).

## To build and run

Run the shell script to start the project under the Spring Shell:

```bash
cd scripts
./shell.sh
```

In this example we leverage the simply, template example agent, `WriteAndReviewAgent`.

This agent uses one LLM with a high temperature and creative persona to write a story based on your input,
then another LLM with a low temperature and different persona to review the story.

Once the application is running then visit `http://localhost:8080" to then click a link to trigger the agent. The instructions to follow the server sent events is described in the accompanying article as it requires a little coordination with a debugger to intercept the running agent while the events are being emitted.

## Provenance

Originally an Agent repository generated by the [Embabel project creator](https://github.com/embabel/project-creator)
using [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uvx/) installed with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install uv
```
